# good-tweet-life
You can get pretty good tweet life on twitter.com

## Why do I create this extension?

I love twitter native web client.
One day, I perticipate some Developpers Event.
The event streamed hash tag tweets.

But, the client which was streaming tweets got some spam tweet.
I just think "We need really good tweet web client".

So, currently official twitter web client has no need pane to just stream has tag tweets.

That's why I create this extension.

## What's good?

This extension has that feathres:

- remove pain without streaming area
- remove spam tweet
- no limited auto load tweet

So! You can get pretty good tweet life on twitter.com!

## How do you use?

It is not provided on Chrome Extension Store.
Because I have no money. (We have to pay $5 if we want to release extension store)

But don't worry, you can use it. because it is open source software.

### 1. How to install your chrome.

So you enable developer mode.

After that, you click 'import unpacked extention'

Finally, you canuse this! Great!
