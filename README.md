# good-tweet-life
You can get pretty good tweet life on twitter.com

## Why do I create this extension?

I love twitter native web client.
One day, I perticipate some Developpers Event.
The event streamed hash tag tweets.

But, the client which was streaming tweets got some spam tweet.
I just think "We need really good tweet web client".

So, currently official twitter web client has no need pane to just stream has tag tweets.

That's why I create this extension.

## What's good?

This extension has that feathres:

- remove pain without streaming area
- remove spam tweet
- no limited auto load tweet

So! You can get pretty good tweet life on twitter.com!
